# DementiaProjectV1
The design brief was that the project needed to help people with dementia by being able to track and record events on a map. Events can be in different forms based on what the user requests.
Event record global coordinates, time, date, description and event types are recorded to a local XML/SOAP file that is read and initialised on startup. The interactable map is imported via GMaps API.

This project was completed using Visual Studio with the ASP.NET development modules.
It uses C#, Gmaps, XML/SOAP & LINQ.

As for the code itself, it uses dictionaries and keys, inheritance, classes, and polymorphism.
